                    I'm a full stack software engineer with a strong focus on TypeScript. I have experience working with React, 
                    Next.js, and Express, and I'm well-versed in both front end and back end development. I'm always eager to learn and improve, 
                    seeking out challenging tasks that force me to improve my problem solving capabilities. I'm searching for a team 
                    that can challenge and help me grow as a software engineer. I believe it's crucial to be part of a team that 
                    values growth and encourages a learning culture, motivating every member to be their best.

                    Outside of programming, I'm a fitness enthusiast and love hitting the gym or going for a run to clear my head. 
                    I'm an avid music listener and love discovering new artists and attending shows. When I'm not busy with my other hobbies, I attend 
                    my duties as a dedicated manservant to my two cats: Freya and Tobago.

            <p class="prose">
            Full stack application built using Next.js, trpc, Prisma, SQL, and TypeScript. DayDash is a work in progress life management dashboard. 
            Utilizing refs and custom hooks, the calendar is fully responsive, ensuring correct positioning of events on different screens. 
            You are able to create, edit, and delete events, as well as tag and label them through a color picker designed with HeadlessUI.
            <br>
            <br>
            The dashboard includes a customizable calendar where users can schedule appointments, set reminders, and manage their time effectively.
            Users can create daily or weekly goals and track their progress over time using an activity graph. This feature helps users to stay motivated and build 
            positive habits. Also included is a bullet journal mimicing todo list, which allows users to create and track tasks.
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal for this project is to create a fully functional dashboard that can be used to manage your life. I plan to add more features in the future, including a
            a superordinate goal hierarchy model that ties into habit formation, creating synergy between your goals and habits. Through use of data visualization, I hope to
            create something that can help users identify and overcome their weaknesses, and ultimately become more satisfied with their progress.

            <p class="prose">
                The application is designed to act as a centralized shipment tracker that draws data from multiple couriers, allowing my company to 
                track the status of our shipments in real-time. It was built using Next.Js, TRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind. To ensure full stack type safety, 
                TypeScript was used throughout the development process.
                <br>
                To obtain real-time tracking data, the application utilizes the Trackingmore tracking API, which provides up-to-date information on 
                shipments from multiple couriers. The application also incorporates filtering capabilities to help users easily find the 
                information they need.

                        A website built to specifications for a client. Utilizing React and NextJS on the front end and allowing for client updates
                        to content via the strapi.io headless CMS. Styled with Tailwind CSS with a mobile first focus, and all design plus typography
                        done by hand. Stylized Google Calendar functionality using Full Calendar and Google API's, as well as form email functionality
                        using the EmailJS SDK with Formik. Led client meetings to discover the business needs and features desired, and then explained 
                        technical implementation overview and advice on whether or not something was a good idea to include in the website. The front end of the 
                        website is hosted on vercel, and the strapi headless CMS is hosted on render. Whenever content is added or updated on the CMS a rebuild 
                        is automatically triggered creating a new statically generated NextJS website using a webhook. I also handled everything domain related,
                        ensuring that both the website and company emails worked properly.
